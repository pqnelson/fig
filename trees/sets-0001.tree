\p{We get started with some set theory. ZFC probably suffices, but we may need to add Grothendieck's axiom of universes (i.e., we may need Tarski-Grothendieck set theory). We won't dwell too long on the axioms, and we may rely on the work of the Mizar Mathematical Library for formalizing mathematics using the Tarski-Grothendieck axioms.}
