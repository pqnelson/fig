\title{Template for Definitions}
\author{alex-nelson}

\p{Definitions should follow the Baez--Dolan [Stuff, Structure, Properties](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/stuff,+structure,+property) template, which can be determined by examining [internal](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internalization) versions of the gadgets interpreting the objects as "stuff", morphisms as "structure", and commutative diagrams as "properties" (e.g., [internal group objects](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/group+object) guided our [definition](group-0001) of a group).}

\p{A lot of definitions in finite group theory do not neatly fit this, and so we adapt as needs must when the devil drives.}
